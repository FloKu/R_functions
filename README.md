# R_functions
Some usefulls R functions, mostly spatial stuff, some genetic stuff.

Feel free to use. If happy, maybe cite. 
If you find any bugs/improvements, please contact me, I am happy to learn.

NOTE: the functions Rfunction_sortQ_v2.R and Rfunction_genind2structure_v2 are minor updates to original functions written by others!
These updates were necessary, as I found the functions to be deprecated, but still, only minor part on my side. 
However, those functions are pretty handy, so dont hesitate to contact orignial authors so that they can update their source.
